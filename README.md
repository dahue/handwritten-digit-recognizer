# handwritten-digit-recognizer
This is an implementation in Python of the handwritten digit recognizer given as an exercise in the machine learning 
course dictated by Andrew Ng in Coursera.

### Description:
  * A 3-layer regularized Neural Network is used for classification
  * Logistic sigmoid function is used as activation function
  * Weights are learned using fmin\_cg for minimizing the cost function
  
### How to use it:
  ```python
  python run.py
  ```
